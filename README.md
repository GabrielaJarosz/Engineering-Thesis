## SUMMARY
### engineering thesis by Gabriela Jarosz
### entitled „Air pollutants long-term variability analysis for selected world cities”

The topic of the thesis concerns air pollution by particulate matter PM_2.5 which causes most health problems for humans. The main purpose of the thesis was to analyse the long-term variability of air pollution in selected cities around the world.

The analyses were conducted for three cities - Delhi, Beijing and Helsinki. The cities differ in terms of area, population density, altitude and climate. Three sensors were selected for each city. The analysis of pollution variability is for three years: 2019, 2020 and 2021. It was decided to create a dashboard and an interactive map with the location of the measurement points in each city. It was created in R language, using RStudio and the shiny package. It was decided to perform descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation and partial autocorrelation. A time series analysis was also performed. The analyses were based on data from the World Air Quality Index project. 

The code includes a dashboard visualization with an interactive map showing the analysis of air pollution for three selected cities, which was part of the engineering thesis. Dashboard can be displayed on a web page: https://s0af5h-gabriela-jarosz.shinyapps.io/inz_GabrielaJarosz/
